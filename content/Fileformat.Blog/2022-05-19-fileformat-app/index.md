## Which file formats are we talking about?

Even at the initial launch stage, we cover almost all files which you use regularly. Below is the brief overview of supported file formats.

### Word Processing Documents

All files that can be opened in Microsoft Office Word. These include DOCX, DOC, RTF, DOCM, DOT, DOTX etc.

Since you know that there are open source alternatives to the MS Office such as Apache OpenOffice and LibreOffice. Their Word Processor (writer) works with Open Document Format types, which is ODT. 

With fileformat.app, you can easily convert, view, split, merge and do a lot of other operations with the MS Word and Open Office files.
